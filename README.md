# Overview
Gradia is a combination of Grade and AI, an app service that provides personalized learning management and grade prediction services based on the user's coursework, learning time, and grade data.

## Goals
* **Provide Personalized Learning Environment**
* **Encourage Active Learning Participation**
* **Support Efficient Time Management**

# Features
## User-Customized Subject Management
* **Subject Selection** : Users can select subjects from the list of subjects registered in the system, or add them to the mangement list by directly entering the subject name.
* **Subject Information Management** : Related information such as the syllabus and exam schedule of the selected subject can be recorded and managed in the system.

## Record and Manage Learning time
* **Enter Daily Learning Time** : Users can easily enter daily learning time for each subject
* **Learning Time Statistics** : Based on the entered learning time, statistics and trends for learning time by subject, day, week, and month are provided visually through graphs
* **Set Learning Time Goals** : User can set learning time goals by subject or overall and check the goal achievement rate

## Difficulty Analysis and Prediction Model Learning
* **User Data Collection** : Collect users' subject-specific study time and actual grade data
* **Model Learning** : Based on the collected data, learn a subject-specific difficulty, study time-to-grade prediction model using a machine learning algorithm
* **Difficulty Provision** : Calculate the difficulty of each subject and provide it to users.

## Personalized Learning Analysis and Recommendation
* **Present Predicted Grades** : Predicted grades for each subject are provided based on the user's study time data
* **Recommend Learning Priority** : Predicted grades and subject difficulty are recommended to the user
* **Recommend Optimal Study Schedule** : Predicted study time is distributed based on the user's study priority and the remaining period is provided
* **Analysis of Strengths and Weeknesses** : Analyze strong and weak subjects based on user data and provides feedback on the direction of improvement
* **Provides Customized Feedback** : Predicted learning advice and improvement directions based on the results of the study pattern analysis
* **Provides Goal Achievement Rate** : Visually provides the achievement rate compared to the goals (Study time, Grades, etc..) set by user

# Expected Effects
* **Increased Learning Efficiency** : Maximize learning efficiency through data-based analysis and customized information
* **Improved Self-Directed Learning Ability** : Improved Self-directed learning ability by increasing understanding of individual learning situations
* **Imporved Grades** : Improved learning performance through efficient learning strategies and time management
